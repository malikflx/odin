  <h3>Description</h3>
  <p>This brown stew chicken is delicious served over steamed rice with green peas, garnished with fresh thyme. I've wanted to make this for a while since I love braised or stewed chicken recipes, especially ones with similar ingredients as jerk chicken. While I might make a few adjustments next time, this came out amazingly well.</p>
  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <h4>For the Marinade</h4>
      <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1/2 cup sliced green onions, white and green parts separated, divided</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons packed dark brown sugar</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons fresh thyme leaves, chopped</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon minced habanero pepper</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon cider vinegar</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons minced fresh giner root</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon smoked paprika</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon ground allspice</li>
      <li>8 (5 ounce) bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs</li>
      <h4>For the Rest:</h4>
      <li>3 tablesppons olive oil, divided</li>
      <li>1 large yellow onion, diced</li>
      <li>1 pinch kosher salt</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon brown sugar</li>
      <li>4 cups chicken broth</li>
      <li>1/3 cup ketchup</li>
      <li>2 each bay leaves</li>
      <li>1 cup sliced carrot</li>
      <li>1 cup quartered baby bell peppers</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Whisk together garlic, white parts of green onions, brown sugar, thyme, habanero, vinegar, ginger, salt, pepper, paprika, and allspice in a large mixing bowl.</li>
      <li>Make 2 cuts, about 1-inch apart, into the skin side of each thigh, perpendicular to the bone, cutting all the way down to the bone. Add chicken thighs to marinade; mix until evenly coated. Cover and place in the refrigerator to marinate, at least 4 hours or up to 12 hours. If possible, flip thighs several times while marinating.</li>
      <li>Remove chicken from marinade. Scrape off any chunks of marinade from chicken into the bowl and reserve for later.</li>
      <li>Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large, deep, heavy-bottomed skillet or Dutch oven over medium-high heat until almost smoking. Working in batches, brown the chicken all over, about 5 minutes per side. Transfer chicken to the marinade bowl; set aside.</li>
      <li>Heat 1 tablespoon oil in the same pan over medium-high heat. Add onion and a pinch of salt; cook until golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in 1 tablespoon brown sugar and cook until onions are dark brown and caramelized, 3 to 5 minutes more.</li>
      <li>Add chicken broth, ketchup, and bay leaves to the pan; bring to a boil. Add carrots, bell peppers, browned chicken thighs, and reserved marinade.</li>
      <li>Reduce heat to medium-low. Simmer, stirring occasionally, until chicken is tender and no longer pink in the center and sauce has reduced and thickened, 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Skim excess fat that floats to the top; baste chicken occasionally with sauce.</li>
      <li>Taste and adjust seasoning. Stir in green parts of green onions.</li>
    </ol>
